<entry key="SC">
The term label SC is used to indicate that a logical operator has originally been "shortcut" operator.

For instance, both conjunction operators in JML (i.e., &amp;&amp; and &amp;) are translated to the same function in JavaDL. To differentiate between the two, the translation of &amp;&amp; adds the label SC. 

This is relevant for welldefinedness checks.
